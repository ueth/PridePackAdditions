# Lineage Pridepack Custom Server Project

This repository includes my custom additions to a Lineage Pridepack server. I've introduced new features and systems with the aim of enhancing gameplay experience. Features include the Fair Games Event, a Rune leveling system, and Battle Passes for both players and clans.

## Features

### Fair Games Event

The Fair Games Event is designed to level the playing field for all players. Upon joining, players can select a new class with base stats for a 1v1 event, including skills and gear. The HTML interfaces for this event are implemented correctly, and a database system tracks match information and player points. Players can also view their stats through an HTML interface.

### Runes

The Rune system lets players level up their runes and gain additional stats. This progress can be tracked on the Community Board through the new UI.

### Battle Passes

Battle Passes are available for players and clans. Progress through the Battle Pass is made by farming experience, participating in events, and engaging in player versus player combat. Progress and rewards can be tracked and viewed through the UI on the Community Board.
